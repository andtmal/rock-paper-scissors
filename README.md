# rock-paper-scissors

This is a classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors now with a UI. It is best out of three. Player will choose which weapon (rock, paper, or scissors) and the game will return the result for each round and the final results at the end of the last round.

Color coded results was also added in for visual appeal of game results.

A "play again" button was added. It appears at the end of the game and refreshes the page to restart the game.
